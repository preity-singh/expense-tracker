## Customization

### Adding New Categories
Update the `ExpenseCategory` type in `src/types/expense.ts`:

export type ExpenseCategory = 
  | 'Food' 
  | 'Transportation' 
  | 'Entertainment' 
  | 'Shopping' 
  | 'Bills' 
  | 'Other'
  | 'YourNewCategory'; // Add your category here
```

### Styling Changes
- Modify Tailwind classes in components
- Update color scheme in component files
- Customize charts in dashboard components

### Data Persistence
To use a real database instead of localStorage:
1. Replace storage utilities in `src/lib/storage.ts`
2. Update context methods in `src/contexts/ExpenseContext.tsx`
3. Add API routes for server communication

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Check for port conflicts (default: 3000)

**Data not persisting:**
- Check browser localStorage permissions
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Ensure localStorage is supported

**Charts not displaying:**
- Ensure you have expense data
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Recharts dependency is installed
